# Ironhack-Week-3-project-Platform-Game
This is my project for Ironhack Week 3. It is an 80s neon style jump to platforms kind of game.

Goal of the game:
  - Get from platform A (left side/ red block) to platform B (right side/ blue block) by jumping on blocks

Rules:

  -The game runs in turns
  
  -Each turn you can jump from one tile to an adjecent one
  
  -You can only make one move per turn
  
  -You have limited time to make your move
  
  -You cannot move backwards
  
  -Always only one tile is safe out of all the tiles availabe to jump on
  
  -If you step on a false tile you fall and loose, and you go back to the beginning
  
  -If you do not make a move in the available time span, the tile you are standing on falls and you lose
  
  -If you get to platform B you win the round.
  
  -In the next round there is a new safe path and the available time to make a move shortens thus increasing the difficulty of the game.
  
  
Good luck and have fun ! :)
